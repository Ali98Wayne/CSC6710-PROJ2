CSC 6710 - Project 2 (Fall 2025)
We consider the design of a database-driven website for managing home-cleaning services for a contractor, Anna Johnson.

The workflow is as follows:
1.	Service Request Submission
2.	Quote & Negotiation
3.	Service Order & Completion
4.	Billing & Payment

Workload for this project: 
1.	Draw an E-R diagram for the system, in particular, use arrows or thick lines to represent constraints appropriately. Write down your assumptions and justifications briefly and clearly. Translate the above E-R diagram into a relational model, i.e., write a set of CREATE TABLE statements. In particular, specify primary key, foreign key and other constraints whenever possible.
2.	Implement all interfaces and functionality described above and then implement the following functionality for the Dashboard for Anna Johnson. 
3.	Frequent clients – List the clients who completed the most service orders.
4.	Uncommitted clients – List clients who submitted 3 or more requests but never completed an order.
5.	This month’s accepted quotes – List all quotes agreed upon in a given month (e.g., December 2024).
6.	Prospective clients – List clients who registered but never submitted any request.
7.	Largest job – List the service requests with the largest number of rooms ever completed.
8.	Overdue bills – List all unpaid bills older than one week.
9.	Bad clients – List clients who never paid any overdue bill.
10.	Good clients – List clients who always paid their bills within 24 hours of being generated.
